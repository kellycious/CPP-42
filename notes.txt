- OOP = organize code around objects (data + behavior)
		objects are created from classes in C++
- Class = define data + functions 
		  ex for a car:data => color, model, speed
		  		   car:functions => accelerating, braking
- Object = Class instance | car created from a a blueprint (class)
- Encapsulation = bundling data + methods within a class 
- Inheritance = allow classes to inherit data/functions from other classes
			    subclass : childclass, superclass : parent class
- Polymorphism =

-stdio streams: input/output stream => #include <iostream> to use input/output OP
				printf(C) => std::cout | std::cerr for error | scanf(C) => std::cin
				std::endl for EOL char, move cursor to next line
				std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl

iterator is like a pointer

ex01
each class has a constructor and a destructor
both are generated by default => will initialize var to default value
need custom if initializing to specific value / dependency to other objects / overload constructor 
"this->" special pointer to current object instance

had to use "std::cin.ignore()" in Contact::input_contact 
	because it would not take into account "\n" as the buffer might not be empty at first
using getline to make sure no empty fields are entered

ex02
time(0) = nb of seconds since UNIX epoch (01/01/1970)
setw(2) = ensure two-digit format + setfill('0') if needed 
adding 1900, because if it is offset 1900 in the struct tm
	made this way to store more memory with smaller data type (2 byte int)

[[[[ CPP 01 ]]]]

ex00
customized constructor to identify the zombie
new function => use malloc and free + call constructor/destructor

ex03
& = when using ref, it's an alias for an existing obj 
* = need to allocate memory bc it is a pointer 

using initialization list for constructor HumanA
	if const or ref var used, initialization list only
	more efficient, direct initialization instead of assignment
	order specificity

ex04
fstream library to manip files 
ifstream existing file manip
ofstream create a new output file (filename)
std::istreambuf_iterator<char>()   =  default constructor for end iterator

[[[[ CPP 02 ]]]]

Orthodox Canonical Form
	Default constructor
	Copy constructor => constructor that calls an existing objects in parameters
	Copy assignment operator => assign one object to another of the same class 
	Destructor
