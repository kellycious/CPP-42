- compilation flag: c++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=c++98

- Output messages needs "\n" at the end
- Forbidden functions/library: C++11 / Boost / printf / alloc / free

- OOP = organize code around objects (data + behavior)
		objects are created from classes in C++
- Class = define data + functions 
		  ex for a car:data => color, model, speed
		  		   car:functions => accelerating, braking
- Object = Class instance | car created from a a blueprint (class)
- Encapsulation = bundling data + methods within a class 
- Inheritance = allow classes to inherit data/functions from other classes
			    subclass : childclass, superclass : parent class
- Polymorphism =

-stdio streams: input/output stream => #include <iostream> to use input/output OP
				printf(C) => std::cout | std::cerr for error | scanf(C) => std::cin
				std::endl for EOL char, move cursor to next line
				std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl

ex00
iterator is like a pointer

ex01
each class has a constructor and a destructor
both are generated by default => will initialize var to default value
need custom if initializing to specific value / dependency to other objects / overload constructor 
"this->" special pointer to current object instance

had to use "std::cin.ignore()" in Contact::input_contact 
	because it would not take into account "\n" as the buffer might not be empty at first
using getline to make sure no empty fields are entered

ex02
time(0) = nb of seconds since UNIX epoch (01/01/1970)
setw(2) = ensure two-digit format + setfill('0') if needed 
adding 1900, because if it is offset 1900 in the struct tm
	made this way to store more memory with smaller data type (2 byte int)

[[[[ CPP 01 ]]]]

ex00
customized constructor to identify the zombie
new function => use malloc and free + call constructor/destructor

ex02
reference is fixed, cannot pick other value like a pointer

ex03
& = when using ref, it's an alias for an existing obj 
* = need to allocate memory bc it is a pointer 

using initialization list for constructor HumanA
	if const or ref var used, initialization list only
	more efficient, direct initialization instead of assignment
	order specificity

ex04
fstream library to manip files 
ifstream existing file manip
ofstream create a new output file (filename)
std::istreambuf_iterator<char>()   =  default constructor for end iterator

[[[[ CPP 02 ]]]]

Orthodox Canonical Form
	Default constructor
	Copy constructor => constructor that calls an existing objects in parameters
	Copy assignment operator => assign one object to another of the same class 
	Destructor

Function overload (ad-hoc polymorphism)
	1 name for multiple different functions but they take different parameters

ex00
- fixed-point (fixed nb point after decimal)
8 bits => 4 bits | 4 bits  (range on the left) (accuracy on the right)
6,5 = 0110 1000
			â†³ 0.5 0.25 0.125 0.625
most range, least accurate 127.5
less range, most accurate  1.9921875

- floating point (more precision than fixed, wider range of nb)
mantissa (5), exponent (3)
2,5 = 01010010 > 0.1010[010] > 010 = 2, so move the point 2x to the right > 010.10

fixed-point faster than floating


ex01
- Operator overload
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream &o, Fixed const &f);
used to apply basic operators to class objects (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise)

[[[[ CPP 03 ]]]]

Inheritance
	derived class from one by adding extra ppties

	Class [new classname] : public [Base classname]
	{ constructor, cpy const, destructor + extra functions };

	base class = superclass | derived class = subclass
	protected: can be used in Inheritance
	private: cannot be accessed outside its own class

[[[[ CPP 04 ]]]]

Virtual functions
	declared in base function, replaced by matching functions in derived class
